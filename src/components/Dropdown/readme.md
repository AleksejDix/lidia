Button markup and ARIA attributes:

Use a <button> element for the dropdown trigger, as it has built-in accessibility features.
Add the aria-haspopup="true" attribute to indicate that the button triggers a dropdown menu.
Use aria-expanded="true" or aria-expanded="false" to reflect the current state of the dropdown (open or closed).
If appropriate, add an aria-controls attribute with the ID of the dropdown box to establish a relationship between the button and the dropdown content.
Dropdown box markup and ARIA attributes:

Use a <div> or <ul> element for the dropdown box, depending on your menu structure.
Assign the role="menu" attribute to the dropdown box to convey its purpose to assistive technologies.
If using a <ul> element, wrap the menu items in <li> elements with role="none" to avoid conflicting semantics with the menuitem role.
Use an ID that corresponds to the aria-controls attribute on the button.
Focus management:

When the dropdown menu is opened, ensure that the focus is either on the first menu item or remains on the button, depending on your design requirements.
When the dropdown menu is closed, return the focus to the button that triggered the dropdown.
Trap the focus within the dropdown menu when it is open, so users can navigate only within the menu items.
Keyboard navigation:

Allow users to open and close the dropdown using the Enter, Space, and Escape keys.
Support arrow key navigation within the dropdown menu.
Visual indicators:

Provide clear visual indicators for the button's state (open or closed) and focused elements.
Screen reader support:

Ensure that your dropdown menu is compatible with screen readers, providing the necessary information and context to users who rely on these assistive technologies.

There are several types of pagination that exist, some of the most common ones include:

# Basic Pagination:

This is the simplest form of pagination where users are provided with a set of page numbers to click through to access different pages.

# Load More Pagination: 

With this type of pagination, more content is loaded as the user scrolls through the page.

# Infinite Scroll Pagination: 

Similar to Load More Pagination, this type of pagination dynamically loads new content as the user scrolls down the page.

# Previous/Next Pagination:

 This type of pagination presents users with Previous and Next buttons to move to the previous or next page of content.

# Alphabetical Pagination: 

Used for navigating through large lists or content, this type of pagination uses alphabetic characters instead of page numbers to help users find what they are looking for.

# Numeric Pagination: 

This type of pagination is similar to Basic Pagination, but instead of just displaying page numbers, it can also include other navigation elements like Previous and Next buttons or a dropdown to jump to a specific page.

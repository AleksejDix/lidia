This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)

```sh
# Install browsers for the first run
npx playwright install

# When testing on CI, must build the project first
npm run build

# Runs the end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
# Runs the tests only on Chromium
npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium
# Runs the tests of a specific file
npm run test:e2e -- tests/example.spec.ts
# Runs the tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e -- --debug
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

Marketing Ideas:

Name and Tagline: Create a catchy name for the component library, something that highlights its eco-friendly, time-saving, and accessible nature. For example: "EcoCompose: Build Efficient, Accessible Web Experiences with Ease."

Website and Documentation: Develop a professional, visually appealing website showcasing the component library's features and benefits. Include comprehensive documentation, demos, and examples to help users get started quickly.

Blog Content: Write a series of blog posts that discuss the advantages of using the component library, such as improved accessibility, efficient development, and reduced code duplication. Share tips and best practices for implementing the library in various web projects.

Social Media: Create engaging social media content to promote the component library, including tips, announcements, and updates. Use hashtags relevant to web development, accessibility, and eco-friendly practices to reach a broader audience.

Case Studies: Collaborate with early adopters of the component library to create case studies, showcasing how the library has helped them save time, money, and energy. Share these success stories on your website, blog, and social media channels.

Video Tutorials: Produce video tutorials demonstrating how to use the component library effectively. Cover topics such as integrating the library into an existing project, customizing components, and implementing accessibility best practices.

Webinars and Workshops: Host webinars and workshops to educate developers on the benefits of using the component library and teach them how to use it effectively. These events can be both in-person and online.

Sponsorships and Partnerships: Partner with popular web development conferences, podcasts, or newsletters to sponsor their events or content. This collaboration will help increase visibility and reach within the web development community.

Open Source Contributions: Make the component library open source, allowing developers to contribute and improve the library. This strategy will encourage community engagement and collaboration.


Overall Design:

Clean and Modern: Adopt a clean, modern design for the reusable components, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

Customizable: Offer customization options through CSS classes, props, or slots to enable developers to adapt the components to their specific design requirements easily.

Mobile-First: Design the components with a mobile-first approach, ensuring they work well on various devices and screen sizes.

Performance: Optimize the components for performance, ensuring fast load times and minimal impact on overall website performance.

Accessibility: Ensure all components adhere to WCAG standards, making them accessible to users with different abilities.

Focus Management and Keyboard Navigation: Build in focus management and keyboard navigation features to make the components keyboard-friendly and enhance overall usability.

Modularity: Design the components to be modular and composable, enabling developers to use them individually or combined to create complex UIs.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensure the components are compatible with all modern browsers and gracefully degrade in older browsers.

Thorough Documentation: Provide extensive documentation, including code snippets and examples, to help developers quickly understand how to use the components and customize them as needed.

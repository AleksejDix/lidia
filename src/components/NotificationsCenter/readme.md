# Notifications

Notifications are an important UI element in web applications to provide users with feedback on the outcome of their actions or to notify them of important events. There are various types of notifications, and two common ones are success and error notifications. These notifications help improve the user experience by keeping users informed about the status of their actions.

Success notifications (also known as "toast" notifications or "snackbars"): These are used to inform users that their action was completed successfully. They usually appear as temporary, non-intrusive pop-up messages, often in the form of a small banner or box, typically in a corner or near the top of the screen. Success notifications are generally green or have a checkmark icon to convey a positive outcome.

Examples of success notifications include:

- "Your changes have been saved."
- "Email sent successfully."
- "Item added to cart."

Error notifications: These are used to alert users that something went wrong during the completion of an action or to highlight a problem that needs their attention. Error notifications can appear as temporary pop-up messages, similar to success notifications, or as more persistent banners, depending on the severity of the issue. They are typically red or have an "X" or warning icon to indicate an error or failure.

Examples of error notifications include:

- "Failed to save changes. Please try again."
- "Email could not be sent. Check your internet connection."
- "Invalid login credentials. Please check your username and password."

Notifications can also include other types of messages, such as informational or warning messages, to provide users with additional context or guidance. In any case, the key to effective notifications is to ensure they are clear, concise, and timely, so users can understand and respond to them as needed.
